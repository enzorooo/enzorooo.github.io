I also constantly jump into multiple side projects on Github only to find myself unable to gain insights from the failures and successes that I have encountered.</p>\n<p>So, last christmas, I decided to hold myself accountable and bought myself a domain to begin working on my very own portfolio website. It is my vision to turn my portfolio website into a space to document my journey across the multitude of things that I am involved in. I also want share it for anyone to see, exposing myself to friends and strangers to perhaps give me some feedback from time to time. Lastly, I want to give myself a constant reason to develop my web development skills, where my goal is to constantly work on providing a better experience for my audience and more importantly myself.</p>\n<h1>The first step to accountability is documenting my work</h1>\n<p>We've all been in the situation, where we find the drive to start something only to stop it mid-way because we lost motivation, or something went wrong, or even worse, it just wasn't living up to our expectations. Well, have you ever considered stopping and asking yourself, why exactly did it not work out? Well, I do ask and answer myself, only to forget about it and lose the lesson from the experience. What a waste, am I right?</p>\n<p>As a self taught programmer, I found that the faster I failed, the faster I learned. But, what if I documented my journey, for every checkpoint in my journey, I write about what went well, what went wrong, and turn them into a list of things I should do less, and what I should do more. Reviewing my failures can produce information how I can avoid replicating my failures, and thereby focus on things that produce a better outcome.</p>\n<p>Where does a portfolio website come into play you may ask? Well, it can be one of many mediums you can place your reflections and lessons to. While some may choose a more private option like a journal, this medium is more for projects and sharings you are more comfortable sharing with the public! Which leads me to my second point...</p>\n<h1>Sharing my work exposes me to a wider range of perspectives</h1>\n<p>Now, I'm not saying people should dictate what you should do.</p>\n<p>But, other people's feedback do give you more options to think about. Listening to your own feedback leaves you at an echo chamber, left with your own opinions there can be about two likely outcomes. First could be, you set your expectations really high, where you end up demotivating yourself because of the absurd level of expectation you set on yourself. Second being, you set the bar too low for yourself that you don't even realize you're putting out content that you yourself would find any value from.</p>\n<p>Now, You can either spend countless amount of effort to benchmark your own quality control system, or you can ask help from friends or even strangers by soliciting feedback enough for you to understand how other people are percieving your output. It allows you to hear other perspectives towards your own outputs. Thus, having more information on how you can further improve your outputs. Just remember, not every opinion might be conveyed in the most ideal manner, tune out the noise and focus on finding feedback that is helpful towards improving your desired output!</p>\n<h1>A platform maintained by myself, will force me to make it better</h1>\n<p>This last point might not apply for everyone. With the advent of no-code website builders, I'd definitely understand that this might not be the most ideal path when making a portfolio website, especially when your skills are not even focused on web development. But, this part is for myself. You see, while I do know how to code, I focus on using my skill set towards understanding data. This is not exactly, web development.</p>\n<p>So, why force myself to learn web development, when I don't exactly have a use case for it right now? Well, I'm just fond of learning. It puts me on the shoes of other people in the industry who I can possibly interact with in multiple occasions. It also allows me to broaden up my skill set allowing me to find different ways to understand and solve different problems that I may encounter.</p>\n<p>I don't exactly work with web development. Therefore, I need to create opportunities for me to learn on my own. While this is more of a want than a need. Forcing myself to maintain my own website will allow me (and thereby force me) to learn how web development works. While it is definitely not the optimal path to learning, it definitely is a path I'm willing to take. We all learn in different ways. Forcing myself to maintain my own platform is one of the many ways I can learn.</p>\n<h1>This is a personal experiment and project, and it's only beginning</h1>\n<p>Creating a portfolio website where blogging is a major aspect will definitely be tough. I would have to learn how to write, plan content, and keep myself accountable. I also have to ensure, that I put out ideas that I am ready to share to the world. If I put out content I'm not ready to share for the sake of putting out content, it's definitely going to bite me back. On top of all that, I have to maintain this website based on my own capacity and skills.</p>\n<p>But, I believe this is definitely a starting point for me to gain greater insights about who I am, while sharing a part of me to whoever is willing to sit through my thoughts. So, if you do find yourself still reading this, this is my first blog post on this website, and hopefully it wouldn't be the last!</p>\n<p>If you find yourself in the same position as I am, lets chat! I would love to talk about diving deeper on how to find greater value in what I am about to invest my time in.</p>","categories":["Project"],"date":"February 25, 2023","description":"In today's digital age, having a well-crafted portfolio website can be the key to unlocking new career opportunities and showcasing your skills to a global audience.
