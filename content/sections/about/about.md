I'm Lorenzo Mercado, a Data Analyst at Thinking Machines Data Science, with expertise in Data Engineering, Data Analysis, Data Transformation, and workflow automations. 

My passion for automating manual processes and saving time led me to develop a skill set in Data Science and Software Development, where I see issues as opportunities for innovation. I've implemented data sync workflows and best data transformation practices, saving hours of daily work. In college, I improved our document approval capacity by 300% by implementing best data structure practices and a Python-built email notification system. 

Outside of work, I enjoy dancing, playing video games, and tinkering with tech gadgets like building PCs. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
